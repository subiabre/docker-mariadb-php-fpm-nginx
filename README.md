This is a template repository that can spring up a PHP app based on:
- php-fpm as runtime
- nginx as server 
- mariadb as database

The goal of this database was to package a template that could support a modern, flexible and high-capacity PHP application shippable to virtually everywhere over docker, but focusing on arm64 devices, and rely entirely on free, open-source software, hence the choice of software.
